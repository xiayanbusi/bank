Andre,5 years ago,Scotiabank is just a terrible bank all around. I thought it would just be one branch but these people are just all around terrible. They don't seem to understand good customer service. Give your business to an independent bank who knows good customer service. You walk in and there's a long line with financial advisers sitting around in their cubicle not willing to help anyone or triage like TD bank. They follow their rigid rules without applying common sense to the situation. I showed them about a dozen pieces of id but unless they wanted one that was on their list they were unwilling (but not unable) to help me. I even logged in to my mobile bank account to show them it was my account. Will no longer consider this bank for any of my financial needs.,1
Karlee Bamford,2 years ago,"Today I had two extremely different interactions with employees from this branch; the one they call Jestina should be reprimanded for her poor customer service (as others here have said in their reviews). I apparently dropped by credit card and someone found it and turned in at this branch. I received a super friendly & helpful phone call from the branch saying that it had been found and that I could come in any time before closing with my debit card & ID to claim it. So when I went to get it I was made to feel like I was crazy, that I was trying to steal someone else's card and that it was impossible that the card had been handed in. The teller called Jestina was incredibly rude to me, she wouldn't listen to me the 3 or 4 times I tried to tell her it was a lost-and-found situation and that I was NOT there to collect a newly issued credit card. When I finally got through to her with that info she was extremely annoyed that I ""didn't tell her that"" and she had been looking in the wrong place the whole time. She told me that next time the bank called me, or if anyone called me for that matter, that I should record their name and phone number - there's simply no way she could help me in this situation without this information. She asked me probably 6-7 times ""WHO called you? WHO called you?"". All three of the other tellers standing on either side of her were staring and giving me sympathetic eyes. Finally the person from the front entrance desk came off of their coffee break and - wow! - problems immediately resolved. Card returned. So. Incredibly. Unnecessarily. Frustrating.",1
Finance Horse,3 years ago,Was turned away from the branch twice saying no advisor available to attend me. Also said cannot book appointment for another branch even though its possible. Customer service 0.  Requests declined.   no intention to solve customer issues or retain business.,1
Adam O'Brien,5 years ago,"Absolutely terrible bank. Rude customer service reps who won't lift a finger to go out of there way to help you. I'm a student and every year they switch my bank account back to a regular account without warning, and I end up paying service fees. They absolutely refuse to even give me a heads up before doing this.

On top of this, their branch hours are ridiculous... often closing at 4 pm on weekdays, very limited saturday hours and no sunday hours (virtually all other banks have sunday hours now). Terrible bank, go with TD if you want a half decent bank.",1
Edward (Kawaii Reviews and More),4 years ago,"Where customer service goes to die.

I??e had the worst experience with the branch manager (Norman?). Complete and utter disregard for customers, concerns or inquiries. Having been falsely charged for purchases not authorized on my behalf, he was unable to provide any appropriate guidance and simply told me to speak with the agent over the phone....while I was still on hold for nearly 45 minutes when speaking with him. No help whatsoever to resolve any issue. This branch and the one located in Scarborough Town Centre is where dreams end and customer service is a disaster.",1
Jennifer Fernandes,6 years ago,"Very poor service. I went in last Saturday to add my husband to my account. I was told the service needed to be done at my home branch. When I went to my home branch today and asked about it, the teller told me that it could be done at any branch. The branch staff here are very unmotivated and I would expect better service from a bank, especially scotiabank. To lie to a customer to avoid doing a task that is part of your role is very unprofessional.",1
Sergio Marino,3 years ago,"Very bad teller!  Wanted to make a deposit to my Line of Credit and I then wanted to know what the balance outstanding remaining was.  I had a Scotia Visa with a the pin and a Scotia Bank card and she wouldn't give it to me.  Started asking me questions about balances on my cards, THAT is what I was there for, to get the answers from her, and she wanted them from me!!!!!  She said she was to verify me!!  I told her this is my Driver license..she said not good enough .....OMG what a Joke of a Branch",1
Rosemarie Taylor,3 years ago,"Most AMAZING Financial Institution ??
I have been a loyal and very happy Scotiabank  client for most of my banking  days.
The Scotiabank branch at 19 Bloor  Street West is beyond our high expectations.
Excellent and professional service with incredible staff.
Our immense thanks to Mr. David Kim for always providing us with the best financial advice with such a friend,6 manner. This branch always seems to attract and select the best staff...  Branch members , financial advisors .thanks to you all...
Dan and Dillon and your team.

Sule McGowan,4 years ago,"I had a simple task of getting change.  I wanted $5 bills for tips for an upcoming event.  I only had $20s.  Because she only had a couple of $5s she gave me them and rest in $10 (rather then getting more from the teller sitting next to her or from someone else) then she asked me to go back and line up again in a very rude manner.  By this time, line was really long.  No basic customer service culture in this branch at all!",1

Boyan Lepoev,2 years ago,"I already feel pity for you, for looking at Scotiabank and its products. 1 star for deceptive targeted marketing, followed by breaking each promise in the original email and now dodging calls. This branch does not feature any particularly helpful people either, including the manager who seems absolutely powerless to provide actual customer service in response to valid complaints. Happy to provide proof to whoever cares. Stay away from this institution, go with one of the other banks.",1
Prasoeur Suon,a year ago,"The worst. First, they set appointment with an employee who stopped working there. Second, they did with an employee who is off on the day of appointment. The rate is higher than other institutions.

Not sure if it's the branch, or scotiabank in general. Or they don't like doing business. Very poor service!!!!!",1
Luke Maynard,2 years ago,"EDIT: When I first moved here, I called this ""a toxic branch with impossible hours."" I don't know if they've come under new management or what, but this branch has been completely renovated, transformed top to bottom, and given some of the best extended hours on a bank branch anywhere in Toronto. This was my least favourite branch  and in the space of two years or so they've completely turned themselves around. Highly recommended, but only in the last 6 months or so. Let's hope they keep everything this great, because the other reviews point out what they used to be like.",5
M M,4 years ago,"Terrible service, unprofessional, was told to look up their bank products online when I was at the teller, why would you ever say that to a customer at your branch?  Going into a branch is for face-to-face interaction, and if you don't know your bank products and need to ask the customer to look online is a terrible way to resolve an inquiry.

Called me from the line up to go to the desk but was not at all ready to help, was fidgeting with money and doing other tasks, I would be fine to wait in line if the teller was not ready to help yet, but instead called me to go over while still working on unfinished tasks and I was standing there for another 5 minutes after my initial question.

Just poorly trained staff, perhaps I was unlucky that day visiting this Scotiabank branch.",1
Mike B,a year ago,"Teller told us don?? show up here again 15 minutes before we close and then when we finished our transaction some other employee yelled at us as he ushered us out.

V K,4 years ago,"Inconvenient hours and unhelpful, inflexible staff. I've had credit cards and a mortgage thru them, and based on the deplorable customer service I've received over and over, I will never do business with them again. If they're going to insist you visit a branch for every tiny thing then they need to make their hours more realistic - what working professional can make it to a bank between 9:30 and 4:30?",1
Naser Deen,3 years ago,"This bank is in a sharp decline. I purchased airline ticket in USD and the exchange rate is absolutely disgusting, as if they have done anything special to deduct 20$ extra out of my checking account. I had another issue and called multiple times, they told me we resolved  the issue and here is confirmation number waited couple of days to see the reflection on my checking account...Nothing !! As if I wasted my  effort time voice mental  for nothing.

I think people should start suing bank of Nova Scotia and it?? terrible careless mangers. Haven?? seen a country that love to rip people out with unnecessarily fees, high exchange rates, high interest rate, yet delivering the service of greyhound bus company !!!!  Do not sign with them, do not deal with them and tell people around you to avoid this institution. Even my scene points declined from 15 free movie to 3 without explanation. Get out!!",1
In?cia Lopes,3 years ago,I'm very happy with my customer service today. Specially because the bank had power off for a couple minutes and during this time most of the staff were very calm and kind. I waited for around 10-15 minutes but I left the bank with smile.,4

jinyuan cai,5 years ago,"Scotialbank is really a terrible bank ! Who the hell closes at 4:00 pm on a busy working day on Wednesday ? The employee in the bank on bloor 19 th location is impatient even when it is not 4:00 pm yet. Everyone wants to leave right on 4:00 . The customer has to say sorry I have kept you late.

In addition , I made an appointment at 4:00 pm to see the adviser and they told us no adviser is available at 4:00 and suggested me to leave and book another time .

In comparison , TD is so much better no matter in operational efficiency and attitude toward custoemrs.

I strongly encourage people not to come to this branch and think of other banks when making a decision .

What a terrible day with Scotialbank!

0 star for sure !",1

This tourist needs to be compensated.
I will contact the branch manager the next step. Extremely poor handling. This Bank gave this Japanese visitor a BAD experience. Because she cant speak proper English she was not helped thus far.

I received a super friendly & helpful phone call from the branch saying that it had been found and that I could come in any time before closing with my debit card & ID to claim it. So when I went to get it I was made to feel like I was crazy, that I was trying to steal someone else's card and that it was impossible that the card had been handed in. The teller called Jestina was incredibly rude to me, she wouldn't listen to me the 3 or 4 times I tried to tell her it was a lost-and-found situation and that I was NOT there to collect a newly issued credit card. When I finally got through to her with that info she was extremely annoyed that I ""didn't tell her that"" and she had been looking in the wrong place the whole time. She told me that next time the bank called me, or if anyone called me for that matter, that I should record their name and phone number - there's simply no way she could help me in this situation without this information. She asked me probably 6-7 times ""WHO called you? WHO called you?"". All three of the other tellers standing on either side of her were staring and giving me sympathetic eyes. Finally the person from the front entrance desk came off of their coffee break and - wow! - problems immediately resolved. Card returned. So. Incredibly. Unnecessarily. Frustrating.",1

No help whatsoever to resolve any issue. This branch and the one located in Scarborough Town Centre is where dreams end and customer service is a disaster.",1
Jennifer Fernandes,6 years ago,"Very poor service. I went in last Saturday to add my husband to my account. I was told the service needed to be done at my home branch. When I went to my home branch today and asked about it, the teller told me that it could be done at any branch. The branch staff here are very unmotivated and I would expect better service from a bank, especially scotiabank. To lie to a customer to avoid doing a task that is part of your role is very unprofessional.",1
Sergio Marino,3 years ago,"Very bad teller!  Wanted to make a deposit to my Line of Credit and I then wanted to know what the balance outstanding remaining was.  I had a Scotia Visa with a the pin and a Scotia Bank card and she wouldn't give it to me.  Started asking me questions about balances on my cards, THAT is what I was there for, to get the answers from her, and she wanted them from me!!!!!  She said she was to verify me!!  I told her this is my Driver license..she said not good enough .....OMG what a Joke of a Branch",1
